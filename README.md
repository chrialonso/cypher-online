## About This Project
This project was built to expand the [Cypher Offline](https://github.com/chrialonso/cypher-offline) version to support cloud synchronization with Supabase. This project was built to learn and explore python, encryption, database security, Supabase, and GUI development.

## Disclaimer
This is a learning project. While it implements real security practices, it has not undergone professional security auditing.
